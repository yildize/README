## Some of my Projects:
### Movie Recommendation App
- Machine learning based movie recommendation app. Users can combine different movies and get suggestions for the provided combination. I trained a collaborative filtering model and obtain embedding vectors for about 60k movies. Recommendations relies on these embedding vectors. Designed a simple front-end with angular and backend with flask.

### Joke Recommender
- Again I trained a collaborative filtering model on some jokes. This recommendation system works a little different than the above. I ask users to rate some jokes first, and based on these jokes, system creates a taste profile for the user (embedding vector of the most similar user based on the ratings). The recommendations is done based on this taste profile.

### "Beauty" Detector 
- It is a computer vision application. Basically the app tries to detect "beauty". This project is done only for educational purposes and fun.
- I collected data using google search. Old version does a binary classification and assign a probability for "beauty" based on the given image.
- So it was basically a binary image classificiation model.

- Later I improved this app, added it some other features. Two different model works on it. One is a multiclass image classifier (based on gender and "beauty" level). Another is an image regressor (age prediction).
